# Noninvasive Blood Glucose Level Monitoring System by Near-infrared Sensor
This project proposes a non-invasive method for monitoring blood glucose levels of diabetic and non-diabetic peoples. A non-invasive method for glucose monitoring provides adequate control and greatly reduces the complications in diabetic patients and consequently reduces the health of the care costs of conventional measuring system. The proposed method uses near infrared sensor for determination of blood glucose. Near-Infrared light is sent through the fingertip. By analyzing the voltage variation received after transmission through fingertip, approximate glucose level is predicted. The obtained glucose level is displayed on an LCD display. This method reduces the complexity, cost and risk of infection of invasive method of glucose determination.
